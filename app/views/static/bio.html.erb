      I finished college with a degree in Communications and while I am grateful for my experience and what I learned, the minor I completed in Computing Technology and Applications ended up providing me with the foundation for my subsequent endeavors into learning to code.

      Once I got over the esoteric stigma I had associated with computer programming, I was able to get my feet wet with markdown language while dabbling in a little bit of CSS along the way.  It wasn't until my time at Launch Academy that I really dove head-first into Ruby and Javascript and immediately gained an immense appreciation for the vastness of the field.

      While there are no shortages of challenges to be had in learning just about anything, the biggest challenge for me in learning to code is in making sure that I am using my time and resources as wisely as I can when trying to understand a problem and the multitude of ways to solve it.

      There were many attractive aspects about the field of software engineering and web development as a whole but the most attractive to me remains the ability to possess, utilize and develop skills relevant to my profession on a daily basis. This is something that I grew to recognize as an imperative element to my professional success and I am incredibly excited to finally start a career that I am truly excited about -- a role in which I can both develop and hone, as well as acquire skills that will only become more and more important in our developing world.
