  <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about">
      I'm an aspiring software engineer and I couldn't be more excited about the prospect of finally working to solve problems with logic and code professionally.
      <br><br>
      My hopes for this site are not grandiose but at the very least, I want to create a modern portfolio with readily accessible, relevant information. I also hope to flush out content, functionality and aesthetics over time as I continue to learn and grow.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for taking the time to look at my site -- if you have any feedback please let me know!
    </p>
